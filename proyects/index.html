                <p>Want to see what time it is in a traditional way? Well, I did this little program with no real use that displays a analog clock. Why? I was bored its all.</p>

                <p>Shows how many time is left for different important events like: Christmass, Halloween, and most importantly, my birthday :)</p>

                <a href="genderselector/"><h2>Gender Selector</h2></a>
                <p>There are a lot of genders right now, so I created this sign up page so you can create an account and select whatever gender you want.</p>

                <p>I have a lot of books in my house, so I decided to rent them out to known people for free. This website is in spanish because I live in a spanish-talking country. Im putting all my books here with the same layout, but I still dont have a website for displaying all the books, so meanwhile just use your browser file display.</p>
            </td>
            <td id="middle-bottom">
                <a href="login/"><h2>Login</h2></a>
                <p>Wanted to practice my JavaScript so I created this login using JavaScript. This is a functional login that works 100% with JavaScript, its just a test and I know everybody can see the user and password.</p>

            <td>
                <a href="super-plane-guide/"><h2>Super Plane Guide</h2></a>
                <p>One of my favorites websites I made, is a simple to use plane guide displaying planes I like. It got planes from a variety of eras and types including some little plane simulator there.</p>
