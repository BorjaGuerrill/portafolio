  <p>The North American Aviation P-51 Mustang is an American long-range, single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber used
    during World War II and the Korean War, among other conflicts. The Mustang was designed in April 1940 by a team
    headed by James H. Kindelberger of North American Aviation (NAA) in response to a requirement of the British
    Purchasing Commission. The commission approached NAA to build Curtiss P-40 fighters under license for the Royal Air
    Force (RAF). Rather than build an old design from another company, NAA proposed the design and production of a more
    modern fighter. The prototype NA-73X airframe was rolled out on 9 September 1940, 102 days after the contract was
    signed, and first flew on 26 October.
    The Mustang was designed to use the Allison V-1710 engine, which had limited high-altitude performance in its
    earlier variants. The aircraft was first flown operationally by the RAF as a tactical-reconnaissance aircraft and
    fighter-bomber (Mustang Mk I). Replacing the Allison with a Rolls-Royce Merlin resulted in the P-51B/C (Mustang Mk
    III) model, and transformed the aircraft's performance at altitudes above 15,000 ft (4,600 m) (without sacrificing
    range), allowing it to compete with the Luftwaffe's fighters. The definitive version, the P-51D, was powered by the
    Packard V-1650-7, a license-built version of the two-speed, two-stage-supercharged Merlin 66, and was armed with six
    .50 caliber (12.7 mm) AN/M2 Browning machine guns.
    From late 1943, P-51Bs and P-51Cs (supplemented by P-51Ds from mid-1944) were used by the USAAF's Eighth Air Force
    to escort bombers in raids over Germany, while the RAF's Second Tactical Air Force and the USAAF's Ninth Air Force
    used the Merlin-powered Mustangs as fighter-bombers, roles in which the Mustang helped ensure Allied air superiority
    in 1944. The P-51 was also used by Allied air forces in the North African, Mediterranean, Italian, and Pacific
    theaters. During World War II, Mustang pilots claimed to have destroyed 4,950 enemy aircraft.
    At the start of the Korean War, the Mustang, by then redesignated F-51, was the main fighter of the United States
    until jet fighters, including North American's F-86, took over this role; the Mustang then became a specialized
    fighter-bomber. Despite the advent of jet fighters, the Mustang remained in service with some air forces until the
    early 1980s. After the Korean War, Mustangs became popular civilian warbirds and air racing aircraft.</p>
