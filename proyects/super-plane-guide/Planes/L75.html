  <p>The Learjet 70/75 is a mid-sized business jet airplane manufactured by the Learjet division of Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier Aerospace. With the end of production in 2022 it is the last Learjet model.
These models feature new avionics, winglets, and powerful engines that use less fuel.
The Learjet 40/45 light jet is updated with touchscreen-controlled Garmin G5000 avionics and a modern interior. The combination of aerodynamic improvements, which lowered the design's drag by 2%, and 200 lbs less weight in the nose section resulted in an increased range of 4%.
The canted winglet design was incorporated from the Bombardier Global 7500/8000.
Both variants are powered by 3,850 lbf (17.1 kN) Honeywell TFE731-40BR turbofans with thrust reversers, have a MTOW of 21,500 lb (9,800 kg) and a fuel capacity of 6,062 lb (2,750 kg) for a maximum range of 2,050 nmi (3,800 km) with four passengers. Typical cruise is Mach .76 and high-speed cruise is Mach .79, the ceiling is FL510 where the cabin altitude is 8,000 ft (2,400 m). Their flat-floor cabin width is 4 ft 11 in by 5 ft 1 in (1.50 by 1.55 m) high, the Learjet 70's seven-seat cabin length is 17 ft 8 in and 19 ft 10 in (5.38 and 6.05 m) for the nine-seat, double-club Learjet 75. The forward galley facing the entry door is isolated by a pocket door from the seating area with a Lufthansa Technik cabin management, and the aft lavatory has a belted seat. The 50 cu ft (1.4 m3) external baggage hold is heated but not pressurized.</p>
